# React + TypeScript + Vite

# My First React Project

## Overview

This is my first React project, where I've built a simple web application using standard HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with React and understand the basics of building modern web applications.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Used to create a dynamic user interface.
- **HTML:** Standard markup language for structuring the project.
- **CSS:** Styling for a visually appealing interface.
- **TypeScript:** Enhancing code quality and maintainability.

## Key Feature

The project incorporates the basic use of the `useState` hook in React. This hook enables the management of local state within functional components, allowing for dynamic rendering and updating of UI elements based on user interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using your preferred development server.

Feel free to explore the code and enjoy the journey of your first React project!
